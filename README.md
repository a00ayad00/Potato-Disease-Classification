# Potato-Disease-Classification

**End to end deep learning project series in `agriculture domain`. Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants.**

**In this project, I classified the potato disease into three classes `[Early_Blight, Healthy, Late_Blight]`**

### The steps I used in this project are:
- 1- Data Collection from Kaggle
- 2- Data Splitting and Augmentation
- 3- Model Designing using CNNs
- 4- Model Testing and Performance Plotting
- 5- Backend Server and MLOps using FastAPI
